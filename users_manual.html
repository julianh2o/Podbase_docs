1.  Links to facilities for changing password (upper right corner), to the manual (lower left), to the Podbase open-source code, to the creator's home page, and for reporting a bug via GitHub (the standard medium for information exchange in Podbase).

2.  A list of links to projects to which you have access (left side)

3.  A link that gets you back to the home page from any page displaying the title, disguised as two face-to-face copepods forming the "db" of the Podbase title (courtesy of Bri)


II.  IMAGE BROWSER TAB
Click a project name to gain access to the project work space.  This will replace the project list with a work space headed by the Image Browser tab (other tabs may appear depending on access lavels granted to you -- see below) and three windows:  the Browser window (left), the Image Thumbnail window (upper right) and the Metadata window (lower right)

A.  IMAGE BROWSING

In the Browser window, browse available images by navigating through the directory tree.  When you reach the desired image, click on it to select, and a thumbnail will appear in the View window.
	1.  Mousing over the thumbnail brings up a larger version
	2.  Double clicking the thumbnail brings up an adjustable image with these options:
		"Move" allows click-and-drag repositioning and scroll-wheel enlargement
		"Measure" allows clicking and dragging across a scale bar, followed by
			click and drag between two points with distance read-out (scale value
                  must be enterd in the window at the top)
		"Adjust" allows brightness and contrast adjustment, either via a slider, or by 
			typing a number in the appropriate window
		"Url" gives a clickable link to the adjusted view, or copy and paste it
			into a separate browser window
	3.  "View image" link brings up additional enlargement options
	4.  "Download image" link for downloading to a file or opening with a program (e.g. Photoshop)
	5.  "Set visible" (if user is granted permission) makes image public
	6.  "Browser link and thumbnail" window has editable-text links to the browser  
		window and the image that can be copy/pasted into summary HTML pages. 
	7.  "Toggle hidden attributes" reveals/hides susceptible metadata attributes

B. SEARCHING

	1.  To search for a single search-string (which does not include spaces), type the string into the window above the directory.  The search will initiate while you type.
	2.  Results of the search will appear as a list of clickable links once the search is complete
	3.  A <space> between two search terms will be interpreted as an "AND" rather than counting the whole string as a single search term.
	4. Use quotes to treat a term with embedded spaces as a single term e.g. "dark glia" vs dark glia [=dark AND glia].

C.  METADATA EDITING

	1, If you are authorized (EDIT_DATA_METADATA), click in the field to the right of the field name (), and it will open for editing, with a cursor bar at the entry point.  Editing is like any other text processing operation.  Click outside the edit box when done to close and save.  There is no "Undo."

	2. Similar editing in Analysis mode for users granted that permission enters data that is not carried back into the Data mode (which is reserved for the original data as recorded at the time the image was entered into the database). This mode is used for preparing metadata for access is authorized by the permission EDIT_ANALYSIS_METADATA.

	3.  "Add new attribute" [for persons with Data_Edit pemission?] - adds an attribute box labeled by what is typed in the set-up screen, then the "value" of the attribute can be entered in the regular data field.  The added atribute carries over into the Analysis mode.  It does not become incorporated in the template -- i.e. it is image-specific.  It can be viewed by all aothorized to view the metadata for that image.  If added in the Analysis mode, it does not carry back into Data mode.

	4.  In either Data mode or Analysis mode, editing data entered previously in that mode generates a model-specific history log, indicated for users authrized to view history by an icon on the right of the data field.  View the history by clicking the icon.

	5.  To produce a link in one of the metadata fields there are two methods:

		a. The preferred method is to type the web address directly http://address.site.  If you want a handle to show instead, type a "pipe" symbol (vertical bar) after 

D.  TEMPLATE CHOICE

	If you are given "SET_TEMPLATE" permission, you can select the template used for a project by clicking the drop-down arrow to the right of the "Template" window at the top of the browser window.
